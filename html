      <h2>Please Read Carefully</h2>
      <p>
        Please read this section carefully, and I have read, understood, and accepted the agreement.
        I hereby understand and acknowledge that the affordability and commitment of my guarantor play a vital role in securing this loan. In case I, the borrower, fail to meet my financial obligations by missing two consecutive installment payments, I hereby authorize Goodseed Hire Purchase Ltd. on behalf of Goodseed Microcredit Enterprise to make withdrawals from the salary of my guarantor to cover the outstanding balance and any accumulated penalties at the current interest rate charged, as stipulated in the loan agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This authorization remains in effect for the duration of the loan agreement and until all financial obligations are met in full. I understand that these salary withdrawals will be executed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I further acknowledge that my guarantor is aware of and consents to this arrangement. I have communicated to the guarantor the potential implications of this authorization, and they have agreed to fulfill this commitment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I, the borrower, affirm my commitment to the terms of this loan agreement and this authorization note. I understand the importance of fulfilling my financial responsibilities and ensuring that my guarantor is protected to the best of my ability.
      </p>
      <h3>Termination of Authorization:</h3>
      <p>
        The authorization for salary withdrawals shall be terminated upon the full repayment of the loan and all other accrued penalties by the borrower.
      </p>
      <h3>Penalties and Interest Rates:</h3>
      <p>
        The borrower acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of missed installments, penalties and interest will be applied at the current interest rate, as specified in the Loan Details section of this agreement. 15% on the installment for late payment beyond the accepted payment date and 25% of the principal if the loan exceeds the maturity date.
      </p>
      <h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
      <p>
        All financial and personal information shared by the parties, including the guarantor's salary information, will be treated confidentially by the lender.
      </p>
      <h3>Unauthorized Guarantor Documents:</h3>
      <p>
        Valid loan security documents must have explicit guarantor consent. Unauthorized submissions release Goodseed Microcredit from liability. We retain the right to reject such documents, verify consent, and take legal action in cases of false information, with the borrower assuming associated liabilities within legal bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        This agreement is effective from the date of signing and shall remain in effect until the loan is fully repaid.
